## Ice discharge parametrization for Antarctica

Find the code for the ice discharge parametrization as submitted
(Nauels et al. 2017) and its calibration here.

Please contact the authors if you would like to rerun the calibration,
as we cannot provide the forcing global mean temperatures and the reference
data from Deconto & Pollard (Nature 2016) within this repository.

Please also have a look at `examples/deconto_pollard_discharge_param.ipynb`
for sample plots and test of different temperature sensitivies.
